## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Set Up NuGet API Key** (Required for releases)

**⚠️ Do this FIRST before creating any release tags!**

1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
2. Create a new API key:
   - Key Name: `CDS.FluentHtmlReports GitHub Actions`
   - Select Scopes: **Push new packages and package versions**
   - Select Packages: **Select specific packages** → `CDS.FluentHtmlReports`
   - Glob Pattern: `CDS.FluentHtmlReports`
3. Copy the generated API key (you'll only see it once!)
4. Add it to GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/nooogle/CDS.FluentHtmlReports/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Name: `NUGET_API_KEY`
   - Value: Paste your API key
   - Click **"Add secret"**

### 2. **Enable Codecov** (Optional - for code coverage badges)

1. Go to https://codecov.io
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add a repository"
4. Select `CDS.FluentHtmlReports`
5. Copy the upload token
6. Add to GitHub secrets:
   - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Codecov token

### 3. **Enable GitHub Discussions** (Optional - for Q&A)

1. Go to https://github.com/nooogle/CDS.FluentHtmlReports/settings
2. Scroll to "Features" section
3. Check ✅ **"Discussions"**
4. Click "Set up discussions"

### 4. **Commit and Push These Files**

```bash
# Add all new files
git add .github/ *.md .gitattributes

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflows and project documentation"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

### 5. **Watch the CI Run**

After pushing, go to:
https://github.com/nooogle/CDS.FluentHtmlReports/actions

You'll see the CI workflow run automatically!

### 6. **Test the Release Process** (After setting up NuGet API key)

When you're ready to release:

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
# Then commit
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Prepare V1.0.0 release"
git push origin master

# Create and push a version tag
git tag V1.0.0
git push origin V1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# ✅ Build and test
# ✅ Create NuGet package
# ✅ Publish to NuGet.org
# ✅ Create GitHub release
```

## 📚 Key Documentation to Read

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Branch Protection**: Go to Settings → Branches and require CI to pass before merging
2. **Auto-merge Dependabot**: Enable Dependabot to keep dependencies updated
3. **Release Notes**: Edit auto-generated release notes to add highlights
4. **Pre-releases**: Tag with `V1.0.0-beta.1` for beta releases

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### CI not running?
- Check that workflows are enabled in Settings → Actions
- Ensure `.github/workflows/` files are committed

### Release not publishing?
- Verify `NUGET_API_KEY` secret is set
- Check tag format: must be `V{major}.{minor}.{patch}` (uppercase `V` — must match `MinVerTagPrefix`)
- View workflow logs in Actions tab

### Badge not showing?
- Wait for first workflow run to complete
- Refresh README page after a few minutes
- Verify repository name in badge URLs

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your project now has:
- ✅ Automated CI/CD
- ✅ Security scanning
